# MyFirstDjangoProject
And my First Usage of GitHub, previously I was using Gitlab,  first I made a repository in new directory so i had to copy-paste every file from Project I was working on, so it is possible that virtual environment doesn't work correctly If you download this Project.

This is my first Django project, and on the beginning I wasn't familiar with startapp so every program is in FirstDjangoWebSite/blog/views.py

In mainpage are just few informations animated in CSS inter alia Libraries Im learning.

The second subpage in the navigation menu is Scanner of the apartment rental market(used request and bs4), as the name suggests, the program will scan the rental market by the cities in Poland, indicated by the user. (Giving us a list of information - link - title - price). I also have a desktop version of this program(additionaly used Workbook and datetime), which works faster and gives the possibility to save the output as an xsl or txt file.

Third seciton is List of programs, so basicly is list with links for other my programs in this project, like sudoku game, or sudoku map generator
